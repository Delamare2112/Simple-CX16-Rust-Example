TODO: mention:
* I didn't see https://github.com/mlund/mos-hardware having much support for x16 at the time of writing.  
* Uses https://github.com/XarkLabs/llvm-mos-sdk to generate the libc.a file (included in LFS (temporarily)).  
  * This fork has asm stubs into C and I use the C lib in Rust.  

I promise to no one that I will make this a proper repo for others to reference... But I hope I do...

run `./build.sh` if you want to build the project.
